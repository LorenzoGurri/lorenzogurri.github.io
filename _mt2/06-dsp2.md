## Delta function
The delta function, sometimes called the **unit impulse**, is a normalized impulse.
It is called the unit impulse since any signal convolved with it is the original
signal.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge x[n]*\delta[n] = x[n])
: (The * symbol is convolution, not multiplication)
{: refdef }


At sample number zero, it has a value of one, and every other value is zero. It is
notated as
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large \delta[n]).
It can be scaled and shifted to resemble any other impulse decomposition component.
For example, if there is an impulse decomposition component with
value of 0.3 at the 4th sample number, the delta function can be manipulated to resemble it:
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large h[n]=0.3\delta[n-8]).
The output it generates, ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large h[n])
also has a name, the **impulse response**. 

## Convolution

Convolution takes two signals and produces a third. More formally, 
it takes the input signal ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large x[n]),
and the impulse response from a linear system
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large h[n]), 
and convolves them into
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large y[n]):

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge y[n]=x[n]*h[n])
{: refdef }

The convolution operator, the star, is not multiplication. It can be represented as the
**convolution sum**:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge y[i]=\sum_{j=0}^{M-1}h[j]x[i-j])
{: refdef }

Where ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large x[n])
is an N point imput signal,
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large h[n])
is an M point impulse response and
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large y[i]) is the 
output signal of length N+M-1. 

Convolution also follows the commutative property, the associative property, and
the distributive property.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge a[n]*b[n] = b[n]*a[n])
: Commutative
{: refdef }


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge(a[n]*b[n])*c[n]=a[n]*(b[n]*c[n]))
: Associative
{: refdef }


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge a[n]*b[n]%2Ba[n]*c[n] = a[n]*(b[n]%2Bc[n]))
: Distributive
{: refdef }

## Simple Filters with The Delta Function

The delta function can be used to make some simple filters like
an amplifier/attenuator or a signal delay/advance. An amplifier/attenuator
would be defined as follows:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge x[n]*k\delta[n]=kn[n])
{: refdef }

This is an amplifier if 
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large k) is greater
than one, and an attenuator if it is less than one.

A signal shift/advance can be defined as follows:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge x[n]*\delta[n%2Bs] = x[n%2Bs])
{: refdef }


## Fourier Transforms

A Fourier transform lets us decompose a signal into sine and cosine
waves. This in tern gives us the ability to turn our signals into the
frequency domain. Depending on the type of signal, different Fourier
transforms need to be used.

### Aperiodic-Continuous

An **aperiodic-continuous** signal doesn't repeat any pattern
and is continuous. For this type of signal, the Fourier
transform used is just called the **Fourier Transform**.

### Periodic-Continuous

A **periodic-continuous** signal has a pattern that is
repeated and is continuous. For this type of signal,
the Fourier transform used is called the **Fourier Series**.

### Aperiodic-Discrete

An **aperiodic-discrete** signal doesn't have a pattern and
is discrete. For this type of signal, the Fourier
transform used is called a **Discrete Fourier Transform**.

### Periodic-Discrete

A **periodic-discrete** signal has a pattern and is discrete.
For this type of signal, the Fourier transform used is also
the **Discrete Fourier Transform**.


Each of these Fourier transforms can be further divided into
real and complex versions. The only form of Fourier transform
that can be used in DSP is the **Discrete Fourier Transform**.

## Real DFT

The real DFT is the version of DFT that uses real numbers.
It takes an N point input signal and outputs two
N/2+1 point output signals which contain the amplitude
data of the sine and cosine wave components. The input
is said to be in the **Time Domain** while the output is
said to be in the **Frequency Domain**. If you know one,
you can get the other. With an input in the time domain,
you can get the frequency domain through the DFT. To get the
time domain from the frequency domain, you can use an inverse DFT.


### Notation

**N**: Number of samples (usually a power of 2).

**Lowercase Letters**: Usually used to represent signals in time domain (e.g. x[n], y[n])

**Uppercase Letters**: Usually used to represent signals in frequency domain (e.g. X[n], Y[n])

**Re X[n]**: Denotes the real part of X[n], aka, the amplitudes of the cosine components

**Im X[n]**: Denotes the imaginary part of X[n], aka, the amplitudes of the sine components

It's important to note that the real and imaginary parts of X[n] don't have anything to
do with a complex DFT.

### Frequency Domain's Independent Variable

The independent variable for the frequency domain can be represented in 4 different ways.
The first labels it with integers zero to N/2. The index is represented as the letter
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large n).
The second is labeled as a fraction of the sample rate (0 to 0.5). The index in this
representation is
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large f).
The third style is the same as the second except it is
multiplied by 
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large 2\pi).
The index used in this representation is
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large \omega) and it
runs from 0 to
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large \pi).
The forth and final representation is in terms of the analog frequencies used in a
specific application. E.g.: In a system with 10kHz, the graph would range from 0 to
5kHz.


### Basis Functions

The sine and cosine components are called the basis functions. They are described
as:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge c_k[i] =\cos(2\pi ki/N))
: Cosine Components
{: refdef }


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge c_k[i] =\sin(2\pi ki/N))
: Sine Components
{: refdef }

Where **i** ranges from **[0,N-1]**, **k** determines frequency and
ranges from **[0,N-1]** and **N** is the number of samples.
A useful property of these equations is that 
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large c_0[n], s_0[n]) and 
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large c_{N/2}[n],s_{N/2}[n])
both have the value of 0.

## Calculating The Real DFT

To calculate the DFT, we can use the following equations.
These get us the real and imaginary components of the signal.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge ReX[k]=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}x[i]\cos(\frac{2\pi ki}{N}))
{: refdef }

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge ImX[k]=-\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}x[i]\sin(\frac{2\pi ki}{N}))
{: refdef }



## The Inverse Real DFT

The inverse DFT, or **synthesis** is just combining the basis functions
together to get a signal.


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge x[i]=\sum_{k=0}^{N/2}
Re \bar{X}[k]\cos(\frac{2\pi ki}{N}) %2B \sum_{k=0}^{N/2}Im\bar{X}[k]\sin(\frac{2\pi ki}{N}))
{: refdef }

Note how the amplitudes are called 
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large \bar{X}) and not
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large X). This is
because a transformation needs to happen before the amplitudes can be used:


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge Re\bar{X}[k]=\frac{ReX[k]}{N/2})
{: refdef }

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge Im\bar{X}[k]=-\frac{ImX[k]}{N/2})
{: refdef }

With the exception of two points. 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge Re\bar{X}[0]=\frac{ReX[0]}{N})
{: refdef }

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge Re\bar{X}[N/2]=\frac{ReX[N/2]}{N})
{: refdef }
